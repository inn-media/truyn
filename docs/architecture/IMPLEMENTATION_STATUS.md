# TRUYN Implementation Status

**Status:** canonical factual status index.

**Snapshot date:** 2026-08-23  
**Software version:** `0.1.0-dev`  
**Protocol generation:** `TRUYN/1` draft

This document answers one question: **what is actually implemented and proven now, versus only designed or planned?**

Architecture documents define contracts. Benchmark reports prove bounded claims. Governance documents define how the standard may change. This file connects those dimensions and MUST be updated when implementation or governance maturity materially changes.

## Status vocabulary

Technical maturity:

- **Defined** — architecture/spec exists.
- **Implemented** — executable reference code exists.
- **CI-proven** — bounded automated tests prove the contract.
- **Bounded real-testnet proven** — exercised across real network processes/hosts in a bounded topology.
- **Productionized** — operational lifecycle, recovery, durability, security and observability gates are satisfied for the intended deployment class.
- **Internet-scale proven** — large real-node/WAN/adversarial evidence exists.
- **Stable** — compatibility guarantees are declared.

Governance maturity uses the independent G0-G5 model defined in `../../GOVERNANCE.md` and `GOVERNANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Governance status boundary

Governance is now an explicit architecture dimension rather than an implicit repository-owner policy.

What is **defined now (G1)**:

- `GOVERNANCE.md` with current bootstrap state, roles, TSC target, voting and maturity model;
- factual role roster in `MAINTAINERS.md`;
- public RFC lifecycle;
- Community → Experimental → Official → Core Candidate → Core extension lifecycle;
- decision classes A-D plus governance changes;
- future TSC quorum, ordinary and two-thirds supermajority rules;
- conflict/recusal/public decision-record expectations;
- architectural separation of protocol governance, repository ownership, infrastructure operation and commercial ownership;
- explicit transition target from Founding Stewardship to multi-organization and neutral stewardship.

What is **not yet factual**:

- a demonstrated external/independent Maintainer cohort (G2);
- a constituted multi-organization TSC (G3);
- three independent constituencies with no single-vendor voting majority;
- neutral legal/foundation/stewardship ownership of marks/namespaces/specification stewardship (G4);
- demonstrated succession/appeals/governance continuity (G5).

Current state must therefore be described as:

> **Public governance architecture/process defined; operational governance remains bootstrap Founding Stewardship.**

It must **not** be described as already neutrally governed, foundation-governed or multi-vendor governed.

GitHub collaborator/CODEOWNERS permissions are implementation controls, not automatic governance roles. The factual role roster is `../../MAINTAINERS.md`.

See `GOVERNANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, `../../GOVERNANCE.md`, `../../MAINTAINERS.md` and `../governance/`.

## A2A / MCP interoperability status boundary

The repository already contains working bounded MCP integration code, so the factual status is **not** “MCP planned only.”

Implemented today:

- TRUYN-as-MCP server over stdio;
- loopback MCP HTTP bridge exposing `truyn_identity`, `truyn_find`, `truyn_offer`, `truyn_need`, `truyn_poll`, `truyn_result`;
- configured remote MCP HTTP tool provider path;
- bounded adapter tests for MCP discovery/tool execution and modern HTTP routing headers.

Not implemented/proven today:

- complete current MCP feature/conformance closure;
- general MCP tool/resource discovery/import;
- any A2A Agent Card/server task bridge;
- any A2A client/provider adapter;
- A2A→TRUYN→MCP or MCP→TRUYN→A2A real round-trip evidence;
- cross-protocol negative security evidence.

The architecture is defined in `A2A_MCP_INTEROPERABILITY.md`; the factual version/support matrix is `../compatibility/A2A_MCP_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

A2A/MCP transport authentication never substitutes for TRUYN provider authorization, billing responsibility or Trustability.

## Developer Experience status boundary

The required stable-v1 first-party SDK targets are:

```text
JavaScript / TypeScript
Python
Go
Java
C# / .NET
```

Rust is an optional additional track and does not replace any of the five required targets.

What is now **defined**:

- common SDK semantic surface;
- SDK security/authorization invariants;
- shared conformance expectations;
- draft TRUYN Agent Descriptor semantics;
- target public well-known path `/.well-known/truyn-agent.json` for intentionally public HTTP-facing participants;
- language/package distribution targets;
- DX-0 through DX-4 implementation gates.

What is **not yet implemented/proven**:

- published first-party SDK packages;
- runtime Agent Descriptor serving/discovery;
- descriptor signature/expiry validation in the SDK/node path;
- shared golden conformance fixtures across languages;
- cross-language CI parity;
- stable SDK compatibility/deprecation guarantees.

The `sdk/` tree must therefore be described as scaffolding/documentation until executable client libraries and conformance evidence exist.

See `SDK_DEVELOPER_EXPERIENCE.md`, `../../spec/protocol/v1/agent-descriptor.md` and `../compatibility/SDK_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## Settlement status boundary

TRUYN/1 is explicitly settlement-neutral. The core does not define a currency, payment processor, blockchain, smart contract or settlement rail.

The first planned external adapter targets are x402 (payment/settlement) and AP2 (verifiable agent payment authorization). Their architecture is defined in `docs/architecture/SETTLEMENT_ADAPTERS.md`, but **no adapter implementation, live money movement or production settlement claim exists yet**.

## Implemented security baseline

The current reference implementation enforces these core invariants:

1. provider access defaults to `owner-only` at the low-level provider policy and provider runtime;
2. unauthorized private providers are filtered before dispatch and checked again before adapter execution;
3. provider ownership is derived from authenticated/signed provider identity, not requester-controlled ownership metadata;
4. owner-funded and BYOK provider execution remain private by default;
5. public provider execution requires explicit opt-in and does not bypass billing policy;
6. local development mode hard-fails when combined with public/production relay markers;
7. oversized HTTP input closes the connection after 413;
8. origin proof is fail-closed and removed before forwarding inward; the generic token mode is expiry/rotation-capable;
9. the accepted production relay additionally sanitizes requester proof at Azure Front Door, injects trusted proof only for `SocketAddr` values within Cloudflare CIDRs, restricts Container Apps ingress to `AzureFrontDoor.Backend`, and denies direct Front Door/Container App HTTP and WebSocket bypass;
10. protected provider M2M proof is transport-only and stripped before the inner relay;
11. sponsored mode cannot activate without an actor-bound signed entitlement verifier and a durable atomic usage store.

Future SDK/Agent Descriptor and A2A/MCP implementations must preserve these invariants. An SDK, descriptor, Agent Card, MCP tool list or external protocol credential must never turn public metadata into private-provider authorization.

Governance cannot vote these security invariants away silently under a stable protocol identifier. Material normative security changes follow the RFC/decision process, except for time-bounded embargoed incident response followed by a public record after safe disclosure.

See `SECURITY.md`, `docs/security/`, `AUTHORIZATION_MODEL.md`, `BILLING_BOUNDARY.md`, `A2A_MCP_INTEROPERABILITY.md`, `SETTLEMENT_ADAPTERS.md`, `SDK_DEVELOPER_EXPERIENCE.md`, `GOVERNANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md` and `RELAY_SECURITY.md`.

## Production relay origin-perimeter status boundary

The current production relay is now **deployment-proven** for direct-origin bypass denial, but this status is intentionally narrower than “all TRUYN deployments are productionized.”

Accepted path:

```text
Cloudflare
  ↓
Azure Front Door SocketAddr sanitize/inject proof
  ↓
Container Apps AzureFrontDoor.Backend-only ingress
  ↓
runtime origin guard
  ↓
inner relay
```

Accepted evidence: `../benchmarks/AZURE_ORIGIN_LOCK_2026-08-23.md`.

Tested source: `9b419e7d11baf6ec0d17e7075238e3d758ef16e4`.

Terminal status: `truyn/origin-lock-live-v22 = success`.

The data-plane gate proved:

- Cloudflare public health remains 200 with `CF-Ray`;
- public HTTP/WebSocket semantics remain available;
- direct Azure Front Door HTTP and WebSocket return 403;
- forged proof on direct Azure Front Door HTTP/WebSocket still returns 403;
- direct Container App HTTP/WebSocket return 403.

Azure Front Door `deploymentStatus` is not used as the decisive readiness signal because it can remain `NotStarted` after successful provisioning. Serving-edge readiness is proven through real data-plane behavior before origin-guard cutover.

Material changes to Cloudflare, Front Door route/rule sets, Cloudflare CIDRs, Container Apps ingress, origin proof or origin topology reopen this gate until the matrix is re-run.

## Evidence discipline

A claim is only promoted to a proven technical maturity when a durable public benchmark/security report exists or the repository CI contract is explicitly referenced. Temporary cloud workflows and Actions logs are operational mechanisms, not the durable evidence ledger.

`docs/benchmarks/` remains append-only. Sensitive fields are redacted; measured reports are not deleted as a security shortcut.

The production origin-lock claim is promoted because a durable report now exists at `../benchmarks/AZURE_ORIGIN_LOCK_2026-08-23.md`; the earlier negative `ORIGIN_BYPASS_SECURITY_EVALUATION_2026-08-16.md` remains preserved as history.

SDK maturity follows the same rule: package publication or a compiling language client is not enough. Cross-language conformance/security evidence is required before promoting SDK parity/stability claims.

A2A/MCP maturity follows the same rule: separate adapter files are not enough. Bidirectional cross-protocol execution, exact-version compatibility and negative provider-security evidence are required before claiming a completed bridge.

Governance maturity follows the same rule: documents can close G1, but G2-G5 require real people/organizations/decisions/legal arrangements. A future foundation name in a document is not evidence of neutral stewardship.

## Current priority

The primary architecture/engineering priority remains **network productionization**. Closing the production relay origin perimeter removes one security blocker but does not by itself establish mainnet readiness or Internet-scale resilience.

SDK/developer experience, bounded A2A/MCP interoperability and governance institution-building are required pre-v1 productization/standardization tracks that may proceed in parallel where they do not depend on unstable protocol decisions. They do not supersede the network productionization gate and must not be used to imply mainnet maturity.

```text
bounded working decentralized primitives
        ↓
real multi-host / WAN / reachability evidence
        ↓
100 real nodes
        ↓
1,000 real nodes
        ↓
Byzantine / Sybil / eclipse / collusion exercises
        ↓
stable operational and compatibility contracts
        ↓
A2A/MCP bridge + negative interoperability evidence
        ↓
SDK DX-1/DX-2/DX-3 completion + five-language conformance
        ↓
TRUYN/1 + A2A/MCP adapter boundary + Agent Descriptor + SDK compatibility stabilization
        ↓
settlement-adapter implementation milestone
```

In parallel, governance evolves independently:

```text
GOV-0/GOV-1 public governance/process — defined
        ↓
GOV-2 open external-maintainer model
        ↓
GOV-3 multi-organization TSC
        ↓
GOV-4 neutral stewardship
        ↓
GOV-5 demonstrated continuity
```

Until the remaining technical gates are passed, TRUYN should be described as an advanced experimental/reference intelligence-network implementation with a deployment-proven production relay perimeter, not a production mainnet. Until the applicable governance gates are passed, it should be described as an open project with defined public governance under bootstrap Founding Stewardship, not as already neutrally governed.
