### Benchmark documentation boundary

Published benchmark reports are part of TRUYN's verification record and are preserved in the repository. A sanitized public report should retain the methodology, measured results, limitations, public model versions, tested commit SHA, workflow/run identity where safe, artifact identity/digest where safe, and provenance needed to audit the claim.

Security review must **redact sensitive fields rather than delete the report**. Credentials, private keys, privileged cloud identities, private deployment/resource names, private origins, customer data, secret-bearing URLs, live allowlists and exact operational quota/cost ceilings remain forbidden. Raw artifacts or logs that contain those details stay outside the public repository; their non-sensitive identifiers and cryptographic digests may remain in the report as evidence.

A benchmark result never grants access to the provider accounts used to produce it.

### Getting started

- [BYOK](getting-started/BYOK.md) — target user-facing provider onboarding and credential-locality contract.
- [MVP Quickstart](getting-started/MVP_QUICKSTART.md) — current executable relay/node MVP with explicit non-production security boundary.
- [MVP AI Interoperability](getting-started/MVP_AI_INTEROP.md) — current adapters and live-demo boundary.

## Architecture status rule

Documents explicitly label whether they describe:

- implemented MVP behavior;
- approved target architecture;
- planned future work.

An approved architecture document is **not** an implementation-complete security claim. A fail-closed requester allowlist gate is now implemented before provider execution, but the broader provider-ownership, tenant, BYOK onboarding, billing/quota, private-discovery, marketplace policy and full v0.6 Trustability resistance model remain incremental implementation work until code/tests prove each layer.

## Public documentation rule

Provider catalogs, model versions, regions, quotas and access requirements change over time. Public architecture documents describe stable TRUYN capabilities and security invariants. Exact deployment details are resolved during preflight/operations and are not published when they reveal private topology, cloud identities, quotas, billing information, privileged allowlists or secret paths.

See [Public / Private Information Boundary](architecture/PUBLIC_PRIVATE_BOUNDARY.md).
