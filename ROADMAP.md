# TRUYN Roadmap

This roadmap describes intended engineering, ecosystem and governance milestones and factual maturity. Protocol semantics live in `spec/`; governance rules live in `GOVERNANCE.md` + `docs/governance/`; measured claims live in `docs/benchmarks/`.

The implementation has not evolved strictly in version order: semantic, provider, Trustability and benchmark layers advanced faster than the physical peer-network underlay. As of 2026-08-17, v0.1 Connect is implemented as a real QUIC/Kademlia/P2P/NAT reference underlay, while several later roadmap slices already have bounded implementations/evidence. The immediate engineering priority is network failure/churn durability and real multi-host scale rather than additional semantic sophistication.

Developer experience is now an explicit implementation track: TRUYN requires first-party SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java and C#/.NET plus a signed TRUYN Agent Descriptor for low-friction discovery/onboarding. The architecture can be implemented in parallel with network productionization, but stable SDK compatibility cannot be claimed before the underlying protocol/interface contracts are stabilized.

A2A/MCP interoperability is also an explicit implementation track. MCP already has bounded executable reference paths; A2A and the generalized bidirectional A2A↔TRUYN↔MCP bridge are defined architecture but remain implementation/evidence work.

Governance and standardization are now a separate mandatory track. TRUYN currently operates under bootstrap Founding Stewardship by InnMedia. Public governance/RFC/extension/decision contracts can be defined immediately, but external maintainers, a multi-organization TSC and neutral legal stewardship require real organizational evidence. A code/spec release MUST NOT be used to imply governance maturity that has not been reached.

Contribution provenance is now part of that governance baseline: new contribution commits require **DCO 1.1** sign-off, the canonical DCO text and contribution-IP policy are public, and the existing CI verifies pull-request commit sign-offs. Repository branch/ruleset protection should require that CI status so the normal merge path cannot bypass the DCO gate.

## Maturity scale

Every substantial subsystem should be described with an explicit maturity state:

1. **Defined** — architecture/specification exists.
2. **Implemented** — executable reference code exists.
3. **CI-proven** — automated tests prove the bounded contract.
4. **Bounded real-testnet proven** — exercised across real network processes/hosts in a bounded topology.
5. **Productionized** — operational lifecycle, recovery, durability, security and observability gates are satisfied for the intended deployment class.
6. **Internet-scale proven** — large real-node/WAN/adversarial evidence exists.
7. **Stable** — compatibility and upgrade guarantees are declared.

A design document does not promote implementation maturity. Conversely, once implementation/evidence exists, the roadmap must stop describing that slice as purely future work.

Governance uses its own factual maturity axis G0→G5 because organizational independence cannot be measured by code maturity. See `GOVERNANCE.md` and `docs/architecture/GOVERNANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

Canonical status matrix: `docs/architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md`.

## Current snapshot — 2026-08-23

| Area | Current maturity |
|---|---|
| TRUYN/1 logical protocol | Defined / partial implementation; still draft |
| v0.1 Connect underlay | Implemented + CI-proven |
| Signed peer-record lifecycle | Implemented + CI-proven; durable renewal/dissemination/PING repair and stale-client invalidation |
| Real QUIC/Kademlia trust-network slice | Bounded real-testnet proven (four-node bounded topology) |
| Semantic retrieval/index/distributed retrieval | Implemented + extensive CI/benchmark evidence |
| Provider ownership/authorization/BYOK | Implemented reference baseline |
| Billing safety | BYOK/owner-funded implemented; sponsored guard implemented but requires external durable store/issuer; prepaid/subscription fail closed |
| A2A/MCP interoperability | **MCP bounded reference paths implemented/CI-covered; A2A and bidirectional A2A↔TRUYN↔MCP bridge defined only** |
| Settlement adapters | **Defined only; implementation intentionally not started. Settlement-neutral core; first targets x402 + AP2** |
| Trustability v1/v2 | Implemented + CI/benchmark proven; bounded real-network trust slice proven |
| Multi-cloud text/image/video providers | Implemented reference adapter paths; individual deployment availability varies |
| SDK / developer experience | **Defined architecture; repository scaffolding only. Required first-party targets: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, C#/.NET. Agent Descriptor draft defined; runtime SDK/descriptor implementation open** |
| Governance / standardization | **G1 public governance architecture/process defined; mandatory DCO 1.1 contribution policy + PR CI verifier implemented; operational governance remains bootstrap Founding Stewardship. External maintainers, multi-org TSC and neutral legal stewardship are not yet facts** |
| Network productionization | **In progress — Class B closed; Class C heterogeneous WAN/reachability remains next** |
| Operations / compatibility / separate security docs | Documentation baseline implemented in current synchronization |
| Mainnet | Not productionized / not stable |

## Immediate security baseline — before wider paid-provider coexistence

The repository already contains an executable MVP/reference implementation and cloud/testnet work. The following boundaries are implemented and must remain invariant:

1. provider ownership bound to authenticated/signed provider identity rather than requester-controlled metadata;
2. server-side authorization before dispatch and again at provider-host execution;
3. default-deny/fail-closed provider behavior;
4. authorization-aware discovery hiding unauthorized private providers;
5. BYOK-by-default onboarding and credential locality;
6. billing responsibility checks before chargeable calls;
7. authenticated protected-provider backchannel option and public/control-plane separation;
8. legacy/fast/WebSocket execution paths preserving equivalent authorization semantics;
9. owner-funded/public-provider misconfiguration denied;
10. negative tests proving foreign users cause zero provider execution;
11. low-level provider policy as well as runtime provider defaults to `owner-only`;
12. local-development mode cannot coexist with public/production relay markers;
13. oversized HTTP body closes the connection after 413;
14. origin proof is expiry-bound and rotation-capable;
15. sponsored mode cannot activate without actor-bound signed entitlement verification and an atomic durable usage store.

This baseline is not a claim that rich account/organization tenancy, commercial entitlement issuance, deployed durable accounting, full A2A/MCP interoperability, settlement adapters, full cloud perimeter proof or mainnet security operations are complete.

## Governance & Standardization Gate — **GOV-0/GOV-1 DEFINED; DCO POLICY + CI IMPLEMENTED; ORGANIZATIONAL GATES OPEN**

Architecture: `docs/architecture/GOVERNANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`.  
Canonical governance: `GOVERNANCE.md`.  
Contribution provenance: `DCO` + `docs/governance/CONTRIBUTION_IP_POLICY.md`.  
Processes: `docs/governance/`.

This track is independent from network/SDK/security implementation maturity. Markdown can define governance, but cannot create independent maintainers, organizations or neutral legal stewardship.

### GOV-0 — Governance contract — **DEFINED**

- [x] publish `GOVERNANCE.md`;
- [x] define Contributor / Maintainer / Subsystem Maintainer / TSC / Chair / Security Response Team roles;
- [x] declare current bootstrap Founding Stewardship honestly;
- [x] separate protocol governance from repository ownership, infrastructure operation and commercial ownership;
- [x] define decision classes A-D plus governance changes;
- [x] define quorum/ordinary/supermajority rules for the future TSC;
- [x] define conflict/recusal and public decision-record expectations;
- [x] publish factual `MAINTAINERS.md` roster;
- [x] adopt and publish mandatory **DCO 1.1** for new contribution commits;
- [x] publish a contribution-IP policy that keeps Apache-2.0 + DCO as the default inbound posture and does not create a vendor-specific CLA/copyright assignment;
- [x] record DCO adoption as a public bootstrap governance decision;
- [x] implement pull-request CI verification of author-matching `Signed-off-by` trailers;
- [ ] require the CI status containing the DCO gate in repository branch/ruleset protection so normal merges cannot bypass a failing sign-off check.

### GOV-1 — RFC + extension framework — **DEFINED**

- [x] public RFC lifecycle and review expectations;
- [x] Community → Experimental → Official → Core Candidate → Core extension lifecycle;
- [x] permissionless third-party Community Extensions in third-party namespaces;
- [x] governance-controlled official `truyn.org` extension namespace target;
- [x] security/compatibility/conformance requirements for Official extensions;
- [x] separate normative RFC required for promotion to Core;
- [x] durable negative/rejected/superseded decision history policy.

### GOV-2 — Open maintainer model — **OPEN / ORGANIZATIONAL**

- [ ] appoint and publicly record earned Maintainers under the published criteria;
- [ ] include meaningful independent/external Maintainer participation;
- [ ] align repository review/CODEOWNERS mechanics with the factual maintainer roster without treating GitHub permission as governance by itself;
- [ ] demonstrate routine Class A review/merge without Founding Steward acting as the only practical reviewer;
- [ ] demonstrate at least one public normative RFC handled under the process.

### GOV-3 — Multi-organization TSC — **OPEN / ORGANIZATIONAL**

- [ ] constitute a TSC with at least three independent organizations/constituencies;
- [ ] no single organization holds a voting majority;
- [ ] publish affiliations, active seats and decision/minutes record;
- [ ] elect/record Chair if used;
- [ ] demonstrate quorum/vote/recusal rules on real decisions;
- [ ] remove Founding Steward as the sole final normative authority.

Only after this gate is factually met may TRUYN claim multi-organization/vendor-neutral governance in operation.

### GOV-4 — Neutral stewardship — **OPEN / LEGAL + ORGANIZATIONAL**

- [ ] select an appropriate neutral legal/stewardship structure (for example a neutral foundation or independent open-standards steward);
- [ ] define/execute stewardship of protocol/spec IP where applicable;
- [ ] define/execute stewardship of TRUYN marks and official namespaces where applicable;
- [ ] adopt a neutral charter consistent with the public governance rules;
- [ ] make infrastructure/administrative dependencies that must be neutral independent of a single commercial vendor.

No documentation change alone can close GOV-4.

### GOV-5 — Stable ecosystem governance — **OPEN**

- [ ] succession process demonstrated;
- [ ] maintainer/TSC inactivity/removal process demonstrated;
- [ ] appeals/escalation process demonstrated;
- [ ] release/deprecation authority demonstrated;
- [ ] security emergency → post-embargo public decision process demonstrated;
- [ ] governance continuity remains functional through organization/personnel changes.

Governance maturity is not a blocker for continuing engineering work, but it is a blocker for claims that TRUYN is already a mature vendor-neutral standard. Stable-v1 technical release and governance maturity remain separately reported dimensions.

## v0.1 — Connect — **IMPLEMENTED / CI-PROVEN REFERENCE UNDERLAY**

Closed: **2026-08-17**

- [x] Cryptographic node identity independent of IP address
- [x] Real QUIC/UDP underlay session
- [x] Signed HELLO/ACCEPT authenticated peer sessions with replay/freshness checks
- [x] Signed peer/bootstrap records
- [x] Kademlia 256-bit XOR routing table
- [x] Iterative peer discovery over authenticated QUIC
- [x] Networked `PING`, `FIND_NODE`, `STORE`, `FIND_VALUE`
- [x] Direct peer-to-peer signed TRUYN envelope communication
- [x] Direct-first routing with explicit relay fallback
- [x] STUN binding discovery
- [x] Same-QUIC-socket UDP hole-punch path
- [x] Explicit bounded backpressure instead of silent direct-path loss
- [x] `OFFER`, `NEED`, `RESULT`
- [x] Minimal `REVOKE` path for offers/keys/results
- [x] `local` and initial `testnet` network profiles
- [x] Provider-policy semantics compatible with owner/tenant/default-private authorization
- [x] Composed `TruynNetworkNode` lifecycle
- [x] Full repository regression/security gate green on the v0.1 evidence commit

Evidence:

- `docs/architecture/NETWORK_UNDERLAY_V01.md`
- `docs/benchmarks/V01_CONNECT_GATE_2026-08-17.md`

Closing v0.1 is **not** a claim that Internet-scale churn, universal NAT traversal, DHT durability or mainnet SLOs are already proved.

## Network Productionization Gate — **PRIMARY NEXT**

Do this before treating TRUYN as a production decentralized network.

Closed/CI-proven prerequisites now include:

- [x] repeatable real multi-host public/private testnet — Class B four-host proof;
- [x] crash/restart identity and durable routing/DHT state reference slice;
- [x] DHT replication, quorum and repair reference slice;
- [x] automatic signed peer-record renewal before expiry;
- [x] renewed peer-record sequence persisted before dissemination;
- [x] authenticated peer-record announcement and later-contact PING repair;
- [x] stale P2P/DHT-RPC client invalidation on newer signed peer state;
- [x] durable bounded admission/backpressure process-restart reference slice.

Still open and required:

- packet-path WAN partition and healing behavior;
- heterogeneous multi-region / multi-provider failure domains;
- NAT/reachability matrix across real network environments, including NAT/CGNAT;
- relay degradation, outage and fallback recovery with production SLO evidence;
- replicated accepted-work survival after underlying host/volume loss;
- 100 simultaneously running real network nodes;
- 1,000 simultaneously running real network nodes;
- Byzantine provider/log behavior, stale-record floods, Sybil pressure, eclipse attempts and collusion exercises on the real underlay;
- measured convergence, packet/byte overhead, p50/p95/p99 and failure recovery across the heterogeneous WAN gate.

Class B is durable evidence. The signed peer-record lifecycle is a later CI-proven productionization prerequisite. Neither fact closes Class C heterogeneous WAN/reachability or Class D scale/adversarial gates.

This gate is deliberately prioritized ahead of further semantic-router feature expansion and ahead of settlement-adapter implementation. SDK/DX, governance organization-building and bounded A2A/MCP interoperability implementation may proceed in parallel, but none may be used to imply network productionization.

## v0.2 — Verify — **SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED / SCALE GATE OPEN**

Original milestone scope:

- `CLAIM`, `ATTEST`
- Active verification behaviors: `CHALLENGE`, `VERIFY`, `DISPUTE`
- Domain-scoped claim-centric Trustability
- Signed provenance
- Trust evidence aggregation and `TRUST_RECEIPT`

Current factual state: claim-centric Trustability, provenance/independence, active lifecycle and receipts have executable implementations and CI/benchmark evidence. A real four-node libp2p QUIC/Kademlia trust-lifecycle slice also proves decentralized verifier discovery, replicated signed transparency/revocation state and churn in a bounded topology.

Remaining: larger real-node adversarial scale, stronger operational authority/revocation lifecycle and stable protocol guarantees.

## v0.3 — Synchronize — **PARTIAL / MIXED**

Original milestone scope:

- Content-addressed `OBJECT`
- `STATE`, `DELTA`, `SUBSCRIBE`
- Cache, freshness, object reuse and invalidation semantics

Current factual state: content-addressed context techniques, persistent semantic index lifecycle, immutable-vector reuse, invalidation and distributed retrieval are implemented and benchmarked. Full generic `STATE`/`DELTA`/`SUBSCRIBE` runtime behavior across the decentralized network remains broader than the currently productionized slices.

## v0.4 — Execute & Route — **PARTIAL / MIXED**

Original milestone scope:

- `COMPUTE` and compute-near-data execution
- Execution policy and sandbox boundary
- Multiple-provider capability routing
- Authorization-before-ranking for private/shared/network providers
- Trust/latency/freshness/cost/privacy selection within the authorized provider set
- Explicit deadline, urgency, priority and decision-value inputs
- Verification effort proportional to decision risk/value
- Billing/usage attribution for chargeable capability execution

Current factual state: multiple-provider routing paths, authorization-before-dispatch, provider-host security/billing gates, semantic routing and provider usage/latency metadata are implemented reference slices. General `COMPUTE` sandboxing, resource isolation, complete compute-near-data execution and durable commercial attribution remain incomplete.

## v0.5 — Interoperate & Developer Experience — **PARTIAL / ACTIVE**

Original interoperability scope:

- MCP adapter
- A2A interoperability edge
- Initial OpenAI/Codex, Claude, Gemini, Grok, Perplexity and local-model adapters
- Provider adapter contract for Copilot, Amazon Q, Cursor, Windsurf, Mistral, DeepSeek, Qwen, Cohere, NVIDIA and future systems
- Public SDK surface
- User-facing BYOK setup for common providers
- Secure local/provider-runtime credential storage contract

Current factual interoperability state: MCP, OpenAI/OpenAI-compatible, Anthropic, Azure OpenAI, Vertex Gemini, custom HTTP and additional project reference provider paths exist; BYOK CLI setup exists for supported profiles; multi-cloud text/image/video reference adapters are present. The MCP edge is more mature than the original roadmap wording: TRUYN-as-MCP stdio/loopback HTTP and a configured remote MCP HTTP tool provider have executable reference code. **A2A is not implemented yet, and there is no proven general A2A↔TRUYN↔MCP bridge.**

### A2A / MCP Interoperability Bridge Gate — **OPEN**

Architecture: `docs/architecture/A2A_MCP_INTEROPERABILITY.md`.  
Factual compatibility matrix: `docs/compatibility/A2A_MCP_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

- [x] TRUYN-as-MCP server reference over stdio;
- [x] loopback MCP HTTP bridge exposing `truyn_identity`, `truyn_find`, `truyn_offer`, `truyn_need`, `truyn_poll`, `truyn_result`;
- [x] configured remote MCP HTTP tool provider reference;
- [ ] close conformance for the selected current MCP `2026-07-28` feature/transport subset, including explicit version/security failure cases;
- [ ] implement general MCP discovery/import for an explicitly selected authorized tool set;
- [ ] implement A2A server facade with authorized Agent Card projection, Message/Task handling and Artifact result projection;
- [ ] implement A2A client/provider adapter that validates a remote Agent Card and exposes explicitly selected skills as TRUYN `OFFER`s;
- [ ] preserve remote A2A/MCP credentials inside adapter/runtime secret boundaries;
- [ ] prove A2A→TRUYN→MCP real round trip;
- [ ] prove MCP→TRUYN→A2A real round trip;
- [ ] prove structured/text and referenced file/artifact integrity/provenance across translation;
- [ ] prove at least one asynchronous A2A task lifecycle;
- [ ] negative-test that A2A Agent Card and MCP discovery cannot expose or execute unauthorized private providers;
- [ ] publish exact-version compatibility matrix and durable sanitized interoperability evidence.

The gate is deliberately adapter-level. A2A Agent Cards, Tasks/Artifacts and MCP Tools/Resources do not become new `TRUYN/1` wire primitives merely because bridges support them.

Developer-experience scope is now explicit:

- [x] define first-party SDK architecture and common semantic surface;
- [x] define draft TRUYN Agent Descriptor for low-friction participant discovery/onboarding;
- [x] reserve/scaffold required language directories;
- [ ] TypeScript/JavaScript SDK implementation + npm package;
- [ ] Python SDK implementation + PyPI package;
- [ ] shared language-independent SDK conformance fixtures/harness;
- [ ] Go SDK implementation + Go module;
- [ ] Java SDK implementation + Maven-compatible publication;
- [ ] C#/.NET SDK implementation + NuGet package;
- [ ] Agent Descriptor serving/discovery + signature/expiry verification in the node/gateway/SDK path;
- [ ] cross-language examples for descriptor → discovery → `NEED` → `RESULT`;
- [ ] CI matrix proving the same authorization/privacy/compatibility semantics in all five first-party SDKs;
- [ ] package/release provenance and compatibility declarations.

The `sdk/` tree is still scaffolding/documentation rather than production client libraries. Broad ecosystem certification, Agent Descriptor runtime support and stable public SDK compatibility remain open.

Architecture:

- `docs/architecture/A2A_MCP_INTEROPERABILITY.md`
- `docs/architecture/SDK_DEVELOPER_EXPERIENCE.md`
- `spec/protocol/v1/agent-descriptor.md`
- `docs/compatibility/A2A_MCP_COMPATIBILITY.md`
- `docs/compatibility/SDK_COMPATIBILITY.md`

## Developer Experience Gate — **REQUIRED PRE-v1 IMPLEMENTATION TRACK**

This gate makes developer onboarding a measurable product requirement rather than a documentation aspiration.

### DX-0 — Contract and scaffolding — **DEFINED**

- [x] five required first-party language targets fixed: JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, C#/.NET;
- [x] Rust explicitly classified as optional secondary track;
- [x] common SDK semantic surface defined;
- [x] TRUYN Agent Descriptor draft defined;
- [x] SDK compatibility/conformance policy defined;
- [x] language documentation scaffolds created.

### DX-1 — Reference SDK pair — **OPEN**

- [ ] TypeScript/JavaScript SDK;
- [ ] Python SDK;
- [ ] shared golden fixtures;
- [ ] Agent Descriptor parser/verifier;
- [ ] identity + authorized discovery + `OFFER`/`NEED`/`RESULT`/`REVOKE` core path;
- [ ] deadline/cancellation/error/artifact handling;
- [ ] runnable local-node examples.

### DX-2 — Enterprise/runtime language parity — **OPEN**

- [ ] Go SDK;
- [ ] Java SDK;
- [ ] C#/.NET SDK;
- [ ] equivalent conformance against DX-1 fixtures;
- [ ] idiomatic async/cancellation/streaming behavior.

### DX-3 — Distribution and onboarding — **OPEN**

- [ ] npm/PyPI/Go/Maven/NuGet publication;
- [ ] tagged/reproducible SDK release process;
- [ ] SDK compatibility matrix;
- [ ] copy-paste quickstarts and sample applications;
- [ ] CI matrix across all five first-party languages.

### DX-4 — Stable SDK gate — **OPEN**

Before v1 stable:

- [ ] all five required first-party SDKs pass the shared conformance suite against stable `TRUYN/1`;
- [ ] Agent Descriptor semantics/version are stabilized;
- [ ] private capability non-disclosure and unauthorized-provider zero-execution are SDK release gates;
- [ ] compatibility/deprecation policy is stable and documented;
- [ ] published package versions are traceable to tagged source.

## v0.6 — Resist & Scale Trust — **IMPLEMENTED SLICES / LARGE REAL-NETWORK GATE OPEN**

Original milestone scope:

- Provenance graph
- Independence/lineage estimation
- Sybil/collusion defenses
- Domain history
- Scalable attestation aggregation, receipts, pruning and revocation propagation
- Provider/resource abuse and anomaly controls

Current factual state: provenance/independence, active trust lifecycle, receipts, decentralized placement/read-quorum work, signed transparency/revocation state, fork/equivocation detection semantics and bounded adversarial evidence exist. Large real-network Sybil/eclipse/collusion pressure remains unproven.

## v0.7 — Measure — **ACTIVE / STRONG EVIDENCE LEDGER**

- [x] Token, latency, request-body, semantic, trust and infrastructure-scale benchmark work exists
- [x] Reproducible public reports are preserved under `docs/benchmarks/`
- [x] Provider-security negative evidence is published without exposing private topology where safe
- [ ] A2A/MCP interoperability evidence after the bridge gate is implemented
- [ ] 100/1,000 simultaneously running **real** network-node evidence
- [ ] large real-WAN adversarial distributions

100/1,000-node simulations or 100k semantic blocks must not be described as 100/1,000 simultaneously running real network nodes.

## v0.8 — Operate — **PARTIAL / DOCUMENTATION BASELINE NOW ESTABLISHED**

Original milestone scope:

- Verified installers for Windows/macOS/Linux
- Service registration for `truynd`
- First-run identity/config/bootstrap lifecycle
- Signed updater channels
- Compatibility preflight, migrations and rollback
- Recovery and uninstall paths
- Operational separation of public data plane, owner control plane and provider backchannels

Current factual state: executable node/relay/provider/testnet paths and cloud test exercises exist; `docs/operations/`, `docs/security/` and `docs/compatibility/` now document the current boundary. Production installers, signed updater/rollback and stable mainnet operations remain open.

## v0.9 — Settle — **DEFINED / IMPLEMENTATION DEFERRED**

TRUYN keeps settlement outside the core protocol. This milestone adds optional external adapters only after the higher-priority network productionization/operational gates are sufficiently mature.

Planned scope:

- [ ] stable settlement-adapter interface outside the TRUYN/1 core wire vocabulary;
- [ ] x402 adapter for machine-native payment requirement, verification and settlement;
- [ ] AP2 adapter for verifiable agent payment authorization through mandates/receipts;
- [ ] AP2 + x402 composition for autonomous paid cross-owner capability execution;
- [ ] opaque external receipt/reference binding to requester/provider/TRUYN transaction context;
- [ ] replay/cross-request-substitution resistance for external settlement evidence;
- [ ] durable accounting/reconciliation bridge from TRUYN usage attribution to external settlement state;
- [ ] sandbox/testnet-first financial testing before any production money movement;
- [ ] negative tests proving payment/settlement metadata cannot bypass provider authorization;
- [ ] negative tests proving failed/absent settlement cannot fall back to owner-funded provider quota;
- [ ] compatibility/versioning rules so x402/AP2 upgrades do not force a TRUYN core protocol generation.

Non-goals:

- no TRUYN currency/token;
- no mandatory blockchain;
- no mandatory smart contract;
- no mandatory payment processor;
- no weakening of BYOK or provider ownership boundaries.

Architecture: `docs/architecture/SETTLEMENT_ADAPTERS.md`.

## v1.0 — Stabilize — **NOT REACHED**

- Stable `TRUYN/1`
- Stable node identity, provider policy, object/state, execution and Trustability contracts
- Stable `local` / `testnet` / `mainnet` semantics
- Production-grade authorization/tenant/BYOK boundary
- Production-grade upgrade/rollback contract
- Explicitly stable external interoperability-adapter boundary for A2A/MCP with tested version policy
- Explicitly stable settlement-neutral extension boundary; settlement adapters remain optional/versioned independently
- Public mainnet bootstrap
- Stable TRUYN Agent Descriptor discovery/versioning contract
- Published and documented first-party SDKs for JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java and C#/.NET
- Shared SDK conformance suite green across all five first-party languages
- Stable SDK compatibility/deprecation policy
- Mandatory DCO 1.1 contribution provenance policy in force with repository enforcement for the normal merge path
- Public governance/RFC/extension process in force and factual governance maturity reported independently of technical release maturity
- No claim of multi-organization/vendor-neutral governance unless GOV-3 is actually closed
- No claim of neutral legal stewardship unless GOV-4 is actually closed

## Post-v1 research track — Capability Economy

- Capability price discovery
- Provider quality/price/trust competition
- Multi-rail settlement interoperability and market operations
- Resource accounting and receipts
- Explicit provider-owner entitlements for cross-owner execution
- No mandatory blockchain or single payment rail

## Current execution order

The network productionization gate remains the primary infrastructure priority. Developer experience, governance institution-building and bounded A2A/MCP interoperability are required productization/standardization tracks and can proceed in parallel where they do not depend on stable protocol choices.

The intended high-level order is:

```text
Class C heterogeneous WAN/reachability
        ↓
100 real nodes / 1,000 real nodes + adversarial scale
        ↓
operational + compatibility stabilization
        ↓
A2A/MCP bridge + negative interoperability evidence
        ↓
DX-1/DX-2/DX-3 completed and conformance-green
        ↓
TRUYN/1 + A2A/MCP adapter boundary + Agent Descriptor + SDK compatibility stabilization
        ↓
optional settlement-adapter implementation / capability-economy expansion
```

In parallel with those technical stages:

```text
GOV-0/GOV-1 public process + DCO contribution provenance — defined/implemented
        ↓
GOV-2 external/earned maintainers
        ↓
GOV-3 multi-organization TSC
        ↓
GOV-4 neutral stewardship
        ↓
GOV-5 demonstrated governance continuity
```

This ordering does not prohibit early SDK, A2A/MCP adapter or governance-organization work. It prevents early package/adapter availability, open source code or public process documents from being confused with a stable mainnet or mature neutral-governance claim.

## Versioning rule

Software releases (`v0.1.0`, `v1.0.0`) and network protocol generations (`TRUYN/1`, `TRUYN/2`) are deliberately separate. A newer node may support multiple protocol generations simultaneously. Current software remains `0.1.0-dev`; `TRUYN/1` remains draft until explicitly stabilized. A2A/MCP external protocol versions and SDK package versions are additional independent compatibility dimensions owned by their adapters/packages rather than by the core TRUYN wire generation.

Governance maturity (G0-G5) is another independent dimension. A software/protocol version number never implies a governance stage.
