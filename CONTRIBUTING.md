# Contributing to TRUYN

TRUYN is an open infrastructure project. Contributions are welcome across protocol design, distributed systems, networking, cryptography, trustability, provider authorization, BYOK, A2A/MCP and other agent interoperability, SDKs, developer experience, benchmarks, documentation, governance, standards work and adversarial testing.

## Governance comes first for normative changes

Contributing code and changing the standard are related but different activities.

Before proposing a normative protocol, stable compatibility, official extension or governance change, read:

- `GOVERNANCE.md`;
- `MAINTAINERS.md`;
- `docs/governance/RFC_PROCESS.md`;
- `docs/governance/EXTENSIONS.md`;
- `docs/governance/DECISION_PROCESS.md`;
- `docs/governance/CONTRIBUTION_IP_POLICY.md`.

Routine non-normative implementation work can use the normal PR process. A PR does not silently acquire normative authority merely because it is merged into the reference implementation.

TRUYN is currently in bootstrap governance: InnMedia is the Founding Steward while the project transitions toward an earned external-maintainer model, a multi-organization TSC and ultimately neutral stewardship. Do not describe current bootstrap control as already vendor-neutral governance.

## License for contributions

TRUYN is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0**. Contributions are accepted under the Apache License 2.0 unless explicitly stated otherwise. See [`LICENSE`](LICENSE).

## Mandatory DCO 1.1 sign-off

TRUYN requires the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) 1.1** for every new contribution commit.

By adding a `Signed-off-by` trailer, you certify the DCO 1.1 terms in [`DCO`](DCO) and confirm that you have the right to submit the contribution under the applicable open-source license.

Create a signed-off commit with:

```bash
git commit -s -m "your commit message"
```

which adds a trailer like:

```text
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

The sign-off is a legal/provenance certification, not a cryptographic signature. CI verifies every commit in a pull request and requires a `Signed-off-by` email matching the commit author's email. A pull request with a missing or mismatched DCO sign-off is not eligible for merge.

To fix the latest unsigned commit:

```bash
git commit --amend --signoff --no-edit
```

For multiple commits, add a sign-off to every contribution commit, for example with an appropriate interactive rebase or:

```bash
git rebase --signoff <base-branch>
```

This requirement applies to code, specifications, tests, SDKs, adapters, documentation, benchmark changes, governance records and repository configuration.

TRUYN does **not** currently require a Contributor License Agreement (CLA), copyright assignment or an InnMedia-specific relicensing grant. DCO 1.1 is the project's inbound contribution provenance mechanism. Any future material change to that posture is a Governance change.

The policy is prospective from adoption and does not require rewriting historical repository commits. See [`docs/governance/CONTRIBUTION_IP_POLICY.md`](docs/governance/CONTRIBUTION_IP_POLICY.md).

## Principles

- Keep the network vendor-neutral.
- Keep governance capable of evolving beyond any single vendor.
- Separate protocol governance, implementation/repository ownership, infrastructure operation and commercial ownership.
- Prefer extensions/adapters before expanding the stable core when a feature can remain independently versioned.
- Separate protocol semantics from adapters, SDK ergonomics and product-specific integrations.
- Treat A2A and MCP as independently versioned interoperability edges rather than new TRUYN/1 wire primitives.
- Preserve backward compatibility once a protocol version is declared stable.
- Prefer measurable claims over marketing claims.
- Document threat models and failure modes.
- Treat capability discovery and provider authorization as separate concerns.
- Preserve the fail-closed/private-by-default provider model.
- Do not add execution paths that bypass central provider authorization.
- Keep provider and remote A2A/MCP credentials at the user/provider runtime boundary; do not put them in protocol envelopes or Agent Descriptors.
- Do not expose private TRUYN providers through public Agent Cards, MCP tool/resource lists or compatibility metadata without authorization.
- Do not commit secrets or private keys.
- Do not publish unnecessary production topology, privileged cloud identities, private origins, allowlists, quotas/cost ceilings or billing information in examples/docs.

## Normative change classification

Use the governance decision classes:

- **Class A** — routine/non-normative implementation or documentation;
- **Class B** — compatible normative change;
- **Class C** — core/normative architecture change;
- **Class D** — breaking stable change requiring a new protocol generation/major boundary;
- **Governance change** — governance/TSC/stewardship rules.

Class B-D and governance changes require the applicable public RFC/decision process. During bootstrap, decisions are recorded explicitly as Founding Steward decisions rather than fictional TSC votes.

## Extensions

Third parties may create Community Extensions in their own namespace without permission.

Project-hosted extension maturity is:

```text
Community → Experimental → Official → Core Candidate → Core
```

Official `truyn.org` extension identifiers and Official TRUYN Extension status require governance approval. Promotion to Core is a separate normative RFC and should be rare.

See `docs/governance/EXTENSIONS.md`.

## SDK and developer-experience contributions

The required first-party SDK targets are:

- JavaScript / TypeScript;
- Python;
- Go;
- Java;
- C# / .NET.

Rust is an optional additional SDK track.

SDK contributions should preserve equivalent TRUYN semantics while remaining idiomatic in the host language. They must not invent protocol behavior absent from `spec/` or move authoritative provider-policy decisions into client code.

New SDK work should include or extend shared conformance coverage for:

- Agent Descriptor parsing/verification;
- protocol/descriptor version handling;
- identity retrieval;
- authorization-aware discovery and private capability non-disclosure;
- `OFFER` publish/revoke;
- `NEED` → `RESULT` correlation;
- timeout/deadline/cancellation;
- artifact/reference handling;
- normalized errors;
- negative security behavior proving unauthorized private-provider execution remains zero.

Agent Descriptor contributions must preserve the distinction:

```text
Agent Descriptor = bootstrap/self-description
OFFER            = dynamic availability/conditions
```

A public/scoped Descriptor must not reveal providers/capabilities that normal provider-policy discovery would hide from the requester.

See `docs/architecture/SDK_DEVELOPER_EXPERIENCE.md`, `sdk/README.md`, `spec/protocol/v1/agent-descriptor.md` and `docs/compatibility/SDK_COMPATIBILITY.md`.

## Provider-security and interoperability changes

Changes affecting relay routing, discovery, Agent Descriptor views, provider registration, A2A/MCP/HTTP/WebSocket/SDK execution, billing/quotas or adapters should explain:

- requester/provider ownership impact;
- authorization boundary;
- external protocol version and fallback behavior where applicable;
- mapping between external objects and TRUYN `OFFER`/`NEED`/`RESULT`/artifact semantics;
- failure behavior when policy or external protocol state is unavailable;
- whether an unauthorized request can cause an upstream provider call;
- whether an external discovery surface can enumerate private providers;
- compatibility with BYOK and private-by-default providers;
- required negative/adversarial tests.

A successful capability match, Descriptor entry, valid A2A/MCP transport credential, SDK discovery result or external task/tool identity is never sufficient reason to bypass provider policy.

For A2A/MCP work, read:

- `docs/architecture/A2A_MCP_INTEROPERABILITY.md`;
- `docs/compatibility/A2A_MCP_COMPATIBILITY.md`;
- the v0.5 Interoperability Bridge Gate in `ROADMAP.md`.

## Before v1.0

The repository is intentionally evolving quickly. Proposed protocol, descriptor, SDK, interoperability or governance changes should explain compatibility impact, security implications, versioning assumptions, governance classification and how they can be tested.

Stable-v1 technical maturity does not by itself prove neutral governance maturity. See the Governance & Standardization Gate in `ROADMAP.md`.

See `ROADMAP.md`, `GOVERNANCE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `DCO`, `spec/`, `sdk/`, `docs/governance/` and `docs/architecture/` for the current direction.
