## Unreleased

### Production relay origin lock — 2026-08-23

- Accepted a deployment-proven production relay perimeter on tested source `9b419e7d11baf6ec0d17e7075238e3d758ef16e4`, terminal context `truyn/origin-lock-live-v22 = success`.
- Final accepted path is Cloudflare → Azure Front Door → Azure Container Apps ingress → runtime origin guard → inner TRUYN relay.
- Azure Front Door now uses an unconditional requester-proof sanitize rule plus `SocketAddr` matching against current Cloudflare CIDRs before trusted origin proof is injected.
- Container Apps relay ingress is restricted to the current `AzureFrontDoor.Backend` service-tag address space.
- The accepted live matrix proves public Cloudflare HTTP/WebSocket semantics remain available while direct Azure Front Door HTTP/WebSocket, forged-proof direct Front Door HTTP/WebSocket and direct Container App HTTP/WebSocket return 403.
- Corrected readiness semantics: Azure Front Door `deploymentStatus` is not treated as authoritative serving-edge convergence because it may remain `NotStarted` despite successful provisioning; accepted cutover uses real data-plane markers before the runtime origin guard is switched.
- Preserved `docs/benchmarks/ORIGIN_BYPASS_SECURITY_EVALUATION_2026-08-16.md` as earlier negative evidence and added `docs/benchmarks/AZURE_ORIGIN_LOCK_2026-08-23.md` as the durable accepted evidence record.
- Updated security architecture/status, relay security, threat model, public edge architecture, operations runbook, architecture contract, implementation status, roadmap, documentation indexes, root `SECURITY.md` and benchmark ledger to reflect the deployment-proven state without promoting the whole network to mainnet/productionized maturity.
- The final accepted origin-authentication boundary does not depend on an Azure WAF policy. WAF/rate limiting remain separate abuse-control layers.
- Removed completed one-shot `tmp-azure-cloudflare-origin-lock*` and `tmp-patch-origin-lock*` executors from the current public tree after acceptance.
- Closed obsolete draft PR #266 as superseded by the accepted `main` evidence and final Rule Set design.

### Governance and standardization architecture — 2026-08-23

- Added root `GOVERNANCE.md` defining current bootstrap Founding Stewardship, earned Maintainer roles, target multi-organization TSC, quorum/voting, conflicts, security exception, neutral-stewardship target and G0→G5 governance maturity.
- Added `MAINTAINERS.md` as a factual role roster that intentionally does not invent external maintainers or a TSC before they exist.
- Added `docs/architecture/GOVERNANCE_ARCHITECTURE.md`, making governance a first-class architecture dimension that controls how normative sources may change while remaining separate from implementation, infrastructure and commercial ownership.
- Added `docs/governance/RFC_PROCESS.md`, `EXTENSIONS.md`, `DECISION_PROCESS.md` and governance index.
- Added reusable RFC, extension-proposal and decision-record templates plus an explicit extension registry that starts empty rather than treating existing adapters as automatically official extensions.
- Defined normative decision classes A-D plus governance changes, public RFC review expectations and future TSC simple-majority/two-thirds-supermajority rules.
- Defined permissionless Community Extensions plus Experimental, Official and Core Candidate tiers; official `truyn.org` extension namespace/status is governance-controlled and promotion to Core requires a separate normative RFC.
- Added the Governance & Standardization Gate to `ROADMAP.md`: GOV-0/GOV-1 are defined now, while GOV-2 external maintainers, GOV-3 multi-organization TSC, GOV-4 neutral legal stewardship and GOV-5 continuity remain factual organizational work.
- Made stable software/protocol maturity independent from governance maturity: a v1 release cannot be used as evidence that TRUYN is already neutrally governed.
- Updated `README.md`, `MANIFESTO.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `STRUCTURE.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `docs/README.md`, `ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md` and `IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` so governance is part of the project DNA/source-of-truth hierarchy rather than an optional community appendix.
- Extended `.github/CODEOWNERS` to protect governance-sensitive files under the current bootstrap owner while explicitly documenting that CODEOWNERS is a review control, not governance authority, and must evolve with the factual GOV-2 maintainer roster.
- Preserved factual honesty: current operational governance remains single-steward/bootstrap; no foundation, multi-organization TSC or neutral stewardship is claimed yet.

### A2A / MCP interoperability architecture — 2026-08-22

- Added `docs/architecture/A2A_MCP_INTEROPERABILITY.md` as the canonical external agent/tool protocol bridge architecture.
- Added `docs/compatibility/A2A_MCP_COMPATIBILITY.md` with a factual maturity/version-support matrix.
- Corrected interoperability status: the repository already has bounded executable MCP server/provider paths; A2A and the general bidirectional A2A↔TRUYN↔MCP bridge remain unimplemented.
- Added an explicit v0.5 A2A/MCP Interoperability Bridge Gate to `ROADMAP.md`, including MCP conformance closure, A2A server/client adapters, bidirectional round-trip proof, artifact/asynchronous-task coverage and negative security evidence.
- Defined A2A Agent Card skill → authorized TRUYN capability/OFFER projection, A2A Message → `NEED`, task/context IDs → adapter correlation state and A2A Artifact → `RESULT`/artifact-reference mapping without adding new TRUYN/1 wire primitives.
- Defined MCP Tools/Resources as adapter-level compatibility objects; general MCP discovery/import remains a future implementation step.
- Made A2A/MCP versions independent compatibility dimensions so external protocol upgrades do not force a TRUYN protocol generation unless core network semantics change.
- Synchronized root README, architecture contract, implementation status, repository structure, adapter docs, compatibility docs and MVP interoperability guide with the new boundary.
- Preserved security invariants: external protocol authentication does not replace TRUYN provider authorization, billing responsibility, Trustability or settlement; public Agent Cards/MCP discovery must not leak private owner-only/BYOK providers.

### SDK / developer experience architecture — 2026-08-22

- Made SDK/developer experience an explicit architecture and roadmap implementation track rather than a generic future `Public SDK surface` item.
- Fixed the required first-party SDK targets as JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Go, Java and C#/.NET; retained Rust as an optional additional track rather than a substitute for those five.
- Added `docs/architecture/SDK_DEVELOPER_EXPERIENCE.md` with common SDK semantics, package/distribution targets, security invariants, shared conformance requirements and DX-0…DX-4 implementation gates.
- Added draft `spec/protocol/v1/agent-descriptor.md` defining the **TRUYN Agent Descriptor** as signed, expiry-bound bootstrap/self-description metadata rather than a new top-level TRUYN envelope kind.
- Reserved `/.well-known/truyn-agent.json` as the target public HTTP discovery location for intentionally public participants while preserving native/direct/registry discovery options.
- Kept the Agent Descriptor distinct from dynamic `OFFER`: Descriptor advertises identity/protocol/interfaces/intentionally visible capability classes; `OFFER` remains dynamic availability/conditions and neither grants provider authorization by itself.
- Added public/scoped Descriptor privacy requirements so private providers/capabilities, credentials, private topology and privileged allowlists cannot leak through onboarding metadata.
- Added SDK scaffolding documentation under `sdk/typescript`, `sdk/python`, `sdk/go`, `sdk/java`, `sdk/dotnet` and `sdk/rust`, with Java and .NET now represented explicitly in the repository structure.
- Added `docs/getting-started/SDK_QUICKSTART.md` with target cross-language onboarding examples and `docs/compatibility/SDK_COMPATIBILITY.md` with protocol/descriptor/SDK versioning and stable-v1 parity requirements.
- Updated README, architecture contract, implementation status, repository structure, compatibility, interoperability guidance and contributing rules to make SDK/Descriptor maturity and security boundaries explicit.
- Stable v1 now requires all five first-party SDKs to pass a shared conformance/security suite against stable TRUYN/1 and a stabilized Agent Descriptor contract.

### Roadmap / status / documentation synchronization — 2026-08-17

- Added `docs/architecture/IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md` as the canonical factual maturity matrix separating Defined, Implemented, CI-proven, bounded real-testnet, Productionized, Internet-scale and Stable states.
- Reworked `ROADMAP.md` so already-implemented Semantic Retrieval, Trustability, provider security/BYOK and benchmark layers are no longer presented as purely future sequential work.
- Kept network productionization as the primary next gate: repeatable real multi-host testnet, churn/partition/recovery, heterogeneous NAT, then 100/1,000 real nodes and real-underlay Byzantine/Sybil/eclipse/collusion exercises.
- Synchronized `ARCHITECTURE_CONTRACT.md`, `AUTHORIZATION_MODEL.md`, `PROVIDER_OWNERSHIP.md`, `BILLING_BOUNDARY.md`, `RELAY_SECURITY.md`, `STRUCTURE.md` and `docs/README.md` with actual implemented/evidenced boundaries.
- Corrected sponsored billing documentation: process-local counters are not a production billing boundary; sponsored activation requires actor-bound signed entitlement verification plus a durable atomic usage store.
- Added real `docs/operations/` documentation for node, testnet and billing operations.
- Added a separate `docs/security/` layer for security architecture status and operational security while retaining root `SECURITY.md` as public policy/reporting entry point.
- Added `docs/compatibility/` documentation separating software, protocol, wire/storage and adapter compatibility; current `0.1.0-dev` / draft `TRUYN/1` remains explicitly pre-stable.

### Network productionization / trust-network status

- Closed v0.1 Connect as an implemented/CI-proven reference underlay with real QUIC/UDP, authenticated peer sessions, Kademlia discovery/state RPC, direct-first P2P, STUN/same-port hole punching, relay fallback and bounded backpressure.
- Added bounded real libp2p QUIC/Kademlia trust-testnet evidence covering decentralized verifier discovery, durable replicated signed transparency/revocation state, bootstrap loss, transport-ID rotation, stale-record tolerance, revocation convergence, stale-receipt rejection and zero relay calls in the tested trust path.
- Closed the signed peer-record lifecycle prerequisite at CI evidence level: automatic renewal before expiry, renewed sequence durability before dissemination, authenticated `peer.announce`, later-contact PING repair and stale P2P/DHT-RPC client invalidation.
- Prevented re-entrant stale-client teardown when a newer signed peer record arrives inside an active PING control response by deferring ingestion until the native QUIC response stack has unwound.
- Class B real multi-host proof remains historical evidence; the later peer-lifecycle CI slice does not relabel that run as renewal/WAN/NAT evidence.
- Class C heterogeneous packet-path WAN, NAT/CGNAT and relay-failure evidence remains open.

### Security hardening — 2026-08-17

- Made the low-level provider access policy default `owner-only`, aligning the bottom security layer with runtime provider default-private behavior.
- Closed oversized-body keep-alive poisoning: oversized HTTP input returns 413 and closes the connection before a fresh request can reuse it.
- Made local-development relay mode hard-fail when combined with public/production markers.
- Added expiry-bound, rotation-capable origin proof and protected-provider machine-to-machine proof boundaries.
- Preserved authorization equivalence across HTTP, WebSocket, fast-path, MCP and other execution-capable routes.

## 0.1.0-dev

- Established initial repository architecture skeleton.
- Added draft TRUYN/1 specification and proto areas.
